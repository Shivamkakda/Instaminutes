first we have to install package from node node-schedule
Then import it from node_modules
Then  declare a dummy array of Name and Date.
Map through the array name and date and schedule jobs as per date mentioned in array,

Use textName as a input in setTimeout time 
it sleep as the length of the name ie. if the name is Shivam then it will print or console the output after 6 sec because it have 6 char
